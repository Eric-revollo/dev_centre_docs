FusionCharts Suite XT includes the FusionCharts server-side ASP.NET wrapper that lets you create interactive, data-driven charts. FusionCharts uses JavaScript and HTML code to generate charts in the browser. Using the wrapper, you can create charts in your browsers without writing any JavaScript code. The required JavaScript and HTML code is generated as a string in the server and inserted in the web page for generating charts. Before we get into the installation process of the wrapper, let's take a look at what sets the wrapper apart.

Some of the basic features of the ASP.NET wrapper are:

* Easily create charts in JavaScript using your C#/VB code.
* Can render charts using **JSON/XML** data or URL.

In this article, we will show you how you can download and install the `FusionCharts ASP.NET` wrapper and all the other dependencies on your system. You can use FusionCharts in your ASP.NET project using direct JavaScript files.

> The FusionCharts ASP.NET server-side wrapper requires a .NET Framework 3.5 or higher.

## Install FusionCharts ASP.NET Wrapper

In order to install and start working with FusionCharts ASP.NET wrapper you need to [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/) the FusionCharts Suite XT package which contains:

* JavaScript files to render **Charts**, **Widgets** and **PowerCharts** under the `js` folder.
* JavaScript files to render maps under `js > maps` folder.
* JavaScript files to include themes under `js > themes` folder.

The folder structure is shown below:

![Js Folder Structure]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/js-folder-structure.gif)

> Copy the files of the `js` folder from fusioncharts-suite-xt to your project folder.

Following is the list of JavaScript files present in your `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js` folder:

File Name|Description|
-|-
`fusioncharts.js`|This is the core FusionCharts library, which you need to import in all your pages where you want to generate a chart, gauge or a map.|
`fusioncharts.charts.js`|This file is required to render all charts present under FusionCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.charts.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.widgets.js`|This file is required to render all gauges present under FusionWidgets XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.widgets.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.powercharts.js`|This file is required to render all charts present under PowerCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.powercharts.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.gantt.js`|This file is required to render the Gantt chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.gantt.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.treemap.js`|This file is required to render the Treemap. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.treemap.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.zoomscatter.js`|This file is required to render the Zoom scatter chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.zoomscatter.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.zoomline.js`|This file is required to render the Zoom line charts. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.zoomline.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.overlappedbar2d.js`|This file is required to render the Overlapped Bar 2D chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.overlappedbar2d.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.overlappedcolumn2d.js`|This file is required to render the Overlapped Column 2D chart, present under FusionCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.overlappedcolumn2d.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.maps.js`|This file is the core map renderer file. The map definitions, however, are stored separately, as explained next. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.maps.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`maps/*`|This folder contains Map Definition files required by each map to be rendered by `fusioncharts.maps.js`. To keep the download package size small, it contains only 2 maps - `fusioncharts.world.js` and `fusioncharts.usa.js`. You can download the definition files of all the 1000+ maps offered by FusionMaps XT from [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab'). </br>**Note:** Replace the map definition files (of v3.12.2 or older) with the latest files available in download package while upgrading to v3.13.0.|
`themes/*`|This folder contains pre-packaged themes that can be applied to charts, gauges, and maps to style them through a central FusionCharts theme files. Refer each theme with their respective `JavaScript` file names.|

Installation of FusionCharts Suite XT is simply copying and pasting the JavaScript files from the downloaded package into your project folder.

* The download package also contains ASP.NET (VB) wrapper under `fusioncharts-suite-xt > integrations > asp.net-vb` folder.

* The download package also contains ASP.NET (C#) wrapper under `fusioncharts-suite-xt > integrations > asp.net-cs` folder. 

The above folders will also contain FusionCharts ASP.NET's native **[Export Handler]({% site.baseurl %}/exporting-charts/using-fc-export-server/server-side-export/setup-private-export-server/asp-net '@@open-newtab')**. The folder structure is shown below:

![ASP.NET Folder Structure]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/aspnet-folder-structure.gif)

> If you are using 3.12.2 or older versions, download v3.13.0 to get the `asp.net-vb` and `asp.net-cs` folders in the FusionCharts Suite XT package. 

To add FusionCharts ASP.NET wrapper in your project:

Drag and drop the class (C#/VB) file from `asp.net-cs/fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for C#) or `asp.net-vb/fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for VB) to `App_Code` folder inside your project.

OR

You can also add a reference to `FusionCharts.dll` in your project to work with either VB or C#. `FusionCharts.dll` is present in `asp.net-cs/fusioncharts-wrapper-assembly` folder or `asp.net-vb/fusioncharts-wrapper-assembly`.

Follow the steps given below to include the files in `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js` folder:

**Step 1: Include the FusionCharts package:**

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
```

**Step 2: Include the theme file. This step is optional, the chart will render with the default theme even if the theme is not applied.:**

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
```

The consolidated code is shown below:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>FusionCharts</title>
    <!-- FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
    <!-- FusionCharts ASP.NET Wrapper -->
</head>
```

This completes the installation of FusionCharts in your application. To see how to create a chart, click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/getting-started/aspnet/your-first-chart-using-aspnet '@@open-newtab').

## Installing FusionMaps (map visualizations) for your project

FusionCharts can provide more than 1000 maps that cater to all your map visualization requirements. But to keep the library lightweight, by default it ships only with two maps - the **world** map, and the **map of the USA**. To render rest of the maps, you need to [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/) the map definition files.

> If you're an existing user of FusionMaps (v3.12.2 or older), you'll need to upgrade the map definition files with the latest files. Read more on this [here]({% site.baseurl %}/upgrading/change-log#improvements-2 '@@open-newtab').

To add FusionCharts ASP.NET wrapper in your project:

Drag and drop the class (C#/VB) file from `asp.net-cs/fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for C#) or `asp.net-vb/fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for VB) to `App_Code` folder inside your project.

OR

You can also add a reference to `FusionCharts.dll` in your project to work with either VB or C#. `FusionCharts.dll` is present in `asp.net-cs/fusioncharts-wrapper-assembly` folder or `asp.net-vb/fusioncharts-wrapper-assembly`.

To render a map, you need the core FusionCharts library `fusioncharts.js` along withÂ `fusioncharts.maps.js`, and the map definition files as shown below:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.maps.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.world.js"></script>
```

In the above example, weâve included the World Map, whose map definition (path) is contained in `maps/fusioncharts.world.js`.

**Load other map definition files**

To use any other map (except world and USA) from the 1000+ maps, [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab') the map definition files, then copy those map files to your current `/maps` folder. The map definition files are named in the format `fusioncharts.[MAP_ALIAS].js`, where MAP_ALIAS represents the country, state or region name. 

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.[MAP_ALIAS].js"></script>
```

Therefore, assuming that you need to render the map of California, the alias name **california** replaces **MAP_ALIAS** in the format as shown below:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.california.js"></script>
```

Click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-guide/getting-started/list-of-maps '@@open-newtab') to explore all the maps available in FusionMaps XT.

The consolidated code looks like as shown below:

```
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>FusionCharts</title>
    <!-- FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <!-- FusionMaps -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.maps.js"></script>
    <!--world -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.california.js"></script>
    <!--Theme -->
    <script type="text/JavaScript" src="path/to/local/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
    <!--FusionCharts ASP.NET Wrapper -->
</head>
```

## Themes

Themes shipped with FusionCharts Suite XT allow you to create centralized theme files and apply those themes to any number of charts.

In a theme file, we can centralize the following aspects of all of your charts, gauges and maps:

* Visual appearance (data plot color, font color, font size, etc.)
* Behavior (hover effects for data plots)
* Intelligence (applying different colors to the positive and negative data plots in all column 2D charts that use the theme)

The FusionCharts Suite download package also contains the predefined theme files under `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js > themes` folder. The folder structure is shown below:

![Theme Folder Structure]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/theme-folder-structure.gif)

> Include the `fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js` file, if you want to set the value of `theme` attribute to `fusion` theme. To add any other theme to your chart, include its corresponding JavaScript file to your project and apply the theme using the `theme` attribute.
