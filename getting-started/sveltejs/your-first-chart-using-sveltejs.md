FusionCharts is a JavaScript charting library that lets you create interactive charts, gauges, maps, and dashboards using JavaScript. We have built a simple and lightweight SvelteJS directive, which provides bindings for `svelte-fusioncharts` and lets you add JavaScript charts in your Svelte application or project without any hassle.

In this page, you will see how to install FusionCharts and render a chart using the `svelte-fusioncharts` directive.

## Prerequisite

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js` and an `npm package manager`. SvelteJS requires Node.js version **10.9.0** or later. To download and install Node.js, please visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

You need to have a Svelte project set up before proceeding any further. If not, you can follow the steps mentioned below, to initiate the project.

Open a new terminal and execute the following command:

```shellscript
npx degit sveltejs/template my-first-svelte-project
```
