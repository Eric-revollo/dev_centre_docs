Starting v3.11.2, the FusionCharts Suite XT is available for installation via the npm and Bower package management softwares. 

For installation via npm and Bower, the charts, widgets, and maps available under FusionCharts Suite XT are divided into two different packages: **fusioncharts** and **fusionmaps**. 

The **fusioncharts** package:

* Includes files for **all 90+ charts and widgets** offered by FusionCharts Suite XT.
* Includes map definition files for **only the World map and the USA map**.
* Is **recommended** if your application **needs only the charts and widgets**.
* Can be **installed faster** because the package size is small.

The **fusionmaps** package:

* Includes files for **all 90+ charts and widgets** offered by FusionCharts Suite XT.
* Includes map definition files for **all the 1000+ maps** that are a part of FusionCharts Suite XT.
* Is **recommended** for download if your application **needs maps other than the world map and the USA map**.
* Takes **longer for installation** because of the map definition files.
