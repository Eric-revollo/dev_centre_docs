By now, we assume that you have already built a single series column chart, and have a basic grasp over the way FusionCharts works. If you have not done so yet, we recommend visiting [Create your first chart tutorial](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/getting-started/plain-javascript/your-first-chart-using-plain-javascript) and returning to this later.

In this tutorial, we shall discuss how you can work with different data formats in FusionCharts. Weâ€™ll be building various types of charts, gauges and maps using FusionCharts.

## Multi-Series Charts

A Multi-series chart is used to plot data for more than one series of data values. It is also used to analyze and compare data points grouped in sub-categories. For example, you can plot the revenue collected each month for the last two years using a multi-series chart. Multi-series charts can also help you plot the highs and lows of multiple datasets, so that you can easily compare them.

In a multi-series chart, we have two or more datasets plotted against the same X-axis (or Y-axis) value. Let us build a Multi-series Column 2D Chart.

{% embed_all standard-charts-multi-series-charts-example-1.js %}

As you can see, a Multi-series Column 2D Chart has vertically aligned rectangular bars on one axis with discrete values shown on the other. The length of a column is proportionate to the value it represents.

To build the chart shown above, we will use the data presented in the following table:

| Quarter | Previous Year | Current Year |
| ----- | ----- | -------- ||
| Q1 | 12000 | 24400 |
| Q2 | 10500 | 29800 |
| Q3 | 23500 | 20800 |
| Q4 | 16000 | 26000 |

In the above chart, we have plotted quarters with data values for the previous and the current years along the X-axis.To convert this to a data format that FusionCharts can use, you need the following two properties:

1. `categories`
2. `dataset`

The diagram below can give you an idea about how we are going to assign values to these properties.
{% embed_chartAnatomy data-format1.json %}

The syntax to use the properties is given below:
```json
"categories": [
  {
    "category":[ 
      { "label": "abc" },
      { "label": "xyz" }
    ]
  }
],
"dataset": [
  {
    "seriesname": "Data Series 1",
    "data": [
      { "value": "xx" },
      { "value": "xx" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "seriesname": "Data Series 2",
    "data": [
      { "value": "xx" },
      { "value": "xx" }
    ]
  }
]
```
> The number of objects passed in the series should be the same as the number of labels.

As shown in the sample above, the chart compares the quarterly sales of a company for over two years. The data in the JSON format for the above chart looks as follows:
```json
// Define the categories representing the labels on the X-axis
const categories =  [
  {
    "category": [
      { "label": "Q1" },
      { "label": "Q2" },
      { "label": "Q3" },
      { "label": "Q4" }
    ]
  }
]
// Construct the dataset comprising multiple series 
const dataset = [
  {
    "seriesname": "Previous Year",
    "data": [
      { "value": "12000" },
      { "value": "10500" },
      { "value": "23500" },
      { "value": "16000" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "seriesname": "Current Year",
    "data": [
      { "value": "24400" },
      { "value": "29800" },
      { "value": "20800" },
      { "value": "26800" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Now that the data is ready, let us dive in directly to render the chart. The consolidated code is given below:
```
FusionCharts.ready(function() {
      var revenueChart = new FusionCharts({
        type: 'mscolumn2d',
        renderAt: 'chart-container',
        width: '700',
        height: '400',
        dataFormat: 'json',
        dataSource: {
          "chart": {
      "theme": "fusion",
            "caption": "Comparison of Quarterly Sales",
            "xAxisname": "Quarter",
            "yAxisName": "Sales"
          },
          "categories": categories,
          "dataset": dataset
        }
      });
      revenueChart.render();
    });
```

You can also create various charts belonging to the multi-series family in a similar way. Check out the different types of multi-series charts here.
