This section is for users who are using previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here we'll talk about the new featured introduced in v3.13.0.

## Overlapped Column 2D and Bar 2D Chart

With version 3.13.0, FusionCharts has come up with a clever and rather effective bar chart to display your data. In this chart, the two data series overlap. The width of the plot for the data series differs which makes the chart easy to compare.

To render the overlapped column 2D chart, set the value of the `type` attribute to `OverlappedColumn2d`. The overlapped column 2D chart looks like:

{% embed_all standard-charts-overlapped-column2d-chart-example-1.js %}

To render the overlapped bar 2D chart, set the value of the `type` attribute to `OverlappedBar2d`. The overlapped bar 2D chart looks like:

{% embed_all standard-charts-overlapped-bar2d-chart-example-1.js %}

## Spline and Spline area charts in Combination Chart

Spline and Spline area charts can now be built as a part of combination charts. To render spline or spline area in combination chart, set the value of one of the `renderAs` attribute to `spline` or `splineArea`.

A combination chart with a spline as a part of it looks like:
