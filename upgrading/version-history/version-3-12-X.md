---

<h2 class="sub-heading">Version 3.12.2 </h2>

<p class="release-date">13th October, 2017</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Improvement</h4>

- TypeScript definition files added to npm package of FusionCharts (fusioncharts & fusionmaps). Previously, the definition files were added from the `definitelytyped` repository.

<h2>Version 3.12.1</h2>

<p class="release-date">3rd July, 2017</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">New Features</h4>

- The FusionCharts export servers have been reconfigured to introduce the following features:

  - The `exportMode` attribute has been introduced to export charts in the auto-export mode (in addition to the server-side export and client-side export modes) that lets users make optimum use of the server-side and client-side export capabilities. Starting v3.12.1, the `exportMode` attribute replaces the 'exportAtClientSide' attribute.

  - Export statistics can now be logged to obtain details like the type of the exported chart, the format in which the chart was exported, IP address of the user exporting the chart, and so on.

  - The `exportAction` attribute has been reconfigured to take one more value, download-save (in addition to the existing values save and download), to send the exported file as a download to the client as well as save a copy on the server.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

- Touch devices now support the swipe gesture for scrolling through the chart area.

- Improved memory consumption for charts that are continuously rendered and disposed.

- Extra white space rendered in a chart has now been controlled. The extra space was rendered in the event of the following changes in the chart's configuration:

  - In scroll-combination charts, the extra space was added around the first and last data points when a large number of data points were plotted on the chart.

  - Extra space was rendered around the first and last data labels in XY charts, when the `xAxisMinValue` and `xAxisMaxValue` attributes were defined, also causing data plot values to flow out of the canvas.

- The `drawCrossLineOnTop` attribute has been introduced to draw the cross line on top of the data plots.

- The `minLabelWidthPercent` attribute has been introduced for improved control over label management.

- Tooltips can now be viewed in the full screen mode.

- The time taken to render multiple charts, especially those plotting a large amount of data, in the IE and Firefox browsers has been improved significantly.

- v3.12.1 comes with improved readability and better management of label overlapping, in case of rotated data labels. Labels are now wrapped into multiple lines when rotated, with gaps between consecutive labels.

- The `onScroll` event and the `scrollTo()` method have been introduced to enable better control over the scrolling activity and to facilitate customization.

- The default width and height of toolbar buttons for touch devices has been set to 20 px. to enable ease of use.

- The `reverseToolbarIcons` attribute has been introduced to reverse the order in which the toolbar icons are rendered.

- In pie charts, when `manageLabelOverflow=1`, the legend no longer overlaps the pie chart data labels.

- Significant improvement in scroll chart performance in terms of initial rendering and scrolling through a chart with large number of data plots.

- Previously, all the data plots were drawn for scroll charts. Now, only the data points in the visible viewport (canvas) are drawn. Therefore, no matter how large the data is, the time taken to render the data plots increases nominally.

- In the angular gauge, the empty space that is rendered when the margins are set to 0 has been reduced.

- In the angular gauge, alignment issues with the trend line's display value have been fixed.

- Previously, the trend line's display value was misaligned if the lower limit value was less than 0.

- Slider issues in the heat map chart have been fixed and the slider is now working as expected.

- Previously, in a fast-paced interaction, the slider did not scroll to the extreme end of the gradient legend scale when the mouse pointer moved out of the scale while still dragging the slider.

- The core maps package has been updated to:

  - Add specification sheets for 81 provinces under Turkey.

<h4>Fixes</h4>

- The `labelLink` attribute is now working as expected.

- Previously, the `labelLink` attribute did not work properly when it was defined using an external link.

- The `chartClick` event is now triggered after the element-specific click events are triggered.

- Previously, the event was triggered before the following click events:

  - _dataLabelClick_ (in 3D charts, error charts & boxandwhisker2d)

  - _connectorClick_ (in the Gantt chart)

  - _processClick_ (in the Gantt chart)

  - _categoryClick_ (in the Gantt chart)

  - _milestoneClick_ (in the Gantt chart)

  - _labelClick_ (in the drag node chart)

  - _linkClicked_

- The Export as XLS feature is now working as expected even when the chart has datasets with blank or null values.

- Overwriting of the values of the `dataIndex` property of the x-axis labels, on scrolling, has been fixed.

- Previously, the data index values were overwritten every time the `dataLabelRollOver` event was triggered.

- Page scrolling issues in touch devices using the IE11 browser, when the chart is swiped or scrolled, have been fixed.

- The client-side batch export feature is now working as expected.

- Previously, attempts to batch export on the client-side threw a JS error.

- Duplication of menu items in the export menu, when multiple charts are rendered on the same page, has been fixed.

- The export callback function is now working as expected.

- JS error thrown by a chart when a hidden container that holds a FusionCharts instance is deleted has been fixed.

- The `toolbarButtonScale` attribute is now working as expected.

- Previously, the size of the toolbar button decreased even when the attribute was assigned a higher value.

- Issues with rendering charts within tooltips have been fixed.

- Issues with finding the container DOM element, if a chart is rendered in a container without an ID, have been fixed.

- In the select scatter chart, data points of a hidden data set are no longer selected.

- Multi-series charts no longer throw a JS error when updated without any data in the dataset.

- Pie and doughnut charts no longer throw a JS error when drilled-down.

- In pie and doughnut charts, multiple invocation of the `dataPlotClick` event, when a pie slice was sliced and when `enableMultiSlicing=0`, has been fixed.

- When multi-slicing is disabled, when one slice is sliced out, the previously sliced out slice is sliced in. Previously, the `dataPlotClick` event was triggered for both these slices, instead of for just the one being sliced out.

- The pie and doughnut charts no longer throw a JS error when updated with all data values set to 0.

- In non-XY charts, category labels are now rendered even when the attribute 'x' is defined from the 'category' object.

- Additional white space rendered in XY charts, when the x-axis is reversed, has been removed.

- Previously, under this instance, the category labels were not shown.

- Data plot label cropping in the Bubble chart has been fixed.

- In the zoom line chart, rendering issues encountered when `allowPinMode=0` have been fixed.

- Previously, when `allowPinMode=0` the zoom line chart threw a JS error and the scroll bar wasn't drawn.

- In the zoom-line chart, behavioral issues encountered when the pinned area is dragged multiple times have been fixed.

- Previously, after being dragged twice, the tracker rectangle was seen to be automatically moving around on the chart.

- In the zoom-line chart, issues related to the zoom out feature, when the `displayStartIndex` and `displayEndIndex` attributes are set using the `setChartAttributes()` method, have been fixed.

- Duplication of the tracker rectangle, when the zoomline chart is resized, has been fixed.

- When the zoomline chart is viewed in the pinned mode, the tracker rectangle pins the selected data points. The tracker rectangle can then be dragged along the chart to compare the pinned data points with the rest of the data points.

- Previously, when the zoomline chart (in the pinned mode) was resized, a duplicate instance of this tracker rectangle was created, which has now been fixed.

- Discrepancies in the assignment of a specific color to a specific state of the pin mode button have been fixed.

- In zoom-line charts with a large amount of data, label overlapping seen upon zooming the chart has been fixed.

- Previously, for a large amount of data, while the initial visualization was rendering okay but labels overlapped upon zooming.

- JS error encountered on data plot hover, when the zoom-scatter chart is rendered in IE9 and above browsers, has been fixed.

- In the zoom-scatter chart, tooltips are now rendered for the trend lines and vertical trend lines, as expected.

- Tooltip positioning issues, when the zoom scatter chart is rendered in IE 9+, have been fixed.

- Previously, when the zoom scatter chart was rendered in IE 9+, the tooltip was not rendered alongside the data plot upon which the mouse pointer was hovered. Instead, it was rendered in the top-left corner of the chart.

- Category label displacement in the Marimekko chart has been fixed.

- In the scroll combination 2D dual y-axis chart, the zero plane is now rendered as expected.

- Previously, when `parentYAxis=P`, the zero plane overlapped the data plots.

- The angular gauge can now be rendered even if the initial value is not specified.

- Previously, in the absence of an initial value, the angular gauge failed to render, returning a JS error.

- The `refreshInterval` attribute in the real-time angular and horizontal linear gauges is now working as expected.

  - It has been fixed to ensure that data updates in the real-time angular and horizontal linear gauges are now triggered according to the value set for the attribute.

  - Previously, the updates were triggered immediately on render, even when `refreshInterval > 0`.

  - Previously, the attribute also did not work when the real-time data value crossed the specified upper limit of the gauge scale.

  - To fix this, the upper limit of the angular and horizontal linear gauges has been configured to update dynamically to accommodate all the real-time values.

- In the angular gauge, the values of the `upperLimitDisplay` and `lowerLimitDisplay` attributes are no longer truncated.

- Previously, in spite of sufficient space being available to display these values, the values were truncated.

- In the horizontal linear gauge, issues related to the rendering of the axis line have been fixed.

- For real-time charts, the `showRTMenuItem` attribute is now working as expected.

- In the real-time column chart, rendering issues with the category labels have been fixed.

- Previously, the category labels disappeared when `labelStep > 1`.

- In the multi-level pie chart, new chart data passed using the `setJSONData` method now successfully overwrites the previous data.

- Previously, the `setJSONData` method caused the new chart data to overlap the previous chart data, instead of replacing it entirely.

- Category label displacement in the Candlestick and drag-node charts has been fixed.

- In the Candlestick chart, rendering issues encountered when the low value of a data plot is set to 0 have been fixed.

- In maps, when the entity value is set to 0, tooltips no longer show the entity value as undefined; the entity value in the tooltip is shown as 0.

<h2>Version 3.12.0</h2>

<p class="release-date">10th March, 2017</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">New Features</h4>

- FusionCharts Suite XT introduces data skipping starting version 3.12.0. In case of huge data, data skipping draws only those plots in the canvas that actually create a data trend.

- The `reverseAxis` attribute has been introduced to reverse the x-axis and set the labels in descending order from left to right in scatter and bubble charts. This attribute works only when the x-axis is represented using `numeric` values. By default, the labels are set in the ascending order.

- An element-called the cross line-has been introduced for all column, bar, area and line 2D charts. It is a vertical line/area used as quick reference for the data plots.

- The following new attributes have been introduced for configuring the cross line:

  - `drawCrossLine`

  - `Crosslinecolor`

  - `Crosslinealpha`

  - `Crosslineanimation`

  - `Crosslineanimationduration`

  - `Tooltipgrayoutcolor`

  - `Plotcolorintooltip`

- Starting v3.12.0, all actions for the chart configurations & space management is executed in a separate thread before rendering the graphics of the chart (that is carried out when the `render()` function is called). Previously, all these actions were executed in the same thread. The `asyncRender` property has been introduced to enable/disable this feature.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

- Tooltip interaction in error charts has been improved to show cumulative plot values when the cursor is hovered upon the upper and lower limits of the error bars. The `cumulativeValueOnErrorBar` attribute has been introduced to enable (or disable) this feature.

- Due to some security policies, usage of eval has been removed for FusionCharts Suite XT. This change affects some of the features of the `link` and `param` attributes.

- The affected features that have now been disabled are:

  - Special characters like `(`, `)`, `-` and `,` cannot be passed as a parameter while function call.

  - Multiple functions cannot be passed after the _Javascript:_ prefix and for the `param` attribute.

  - A function cannot be defined after `Javascript:` prefix and for `param` attribute.

- **In order to avoid the use of 'eval', FusionCharts has also discontinued support for the JSON object for IE <= 7 browser versions. Users who wish to continue with the use of the JSON object can request a custom FusionCharts build from us.**

<h4>Fixes</h4>

- For bar charts, the `showLabels` attribute is now working as expected. Previously, when set to `0`, this attribute was not hiding the x-axis labels while updating the chart.

- For all charts, the `$label` macro is now working as expected at all levels (data, dataset and category) of the chart. Previously, it was duplicating the string used in the tooltext.

- For multi-series line, all column and bar charts, the `dashed` attribute is now working as expected. Previously, this attribute was not working when specified at the data and dataset levels.

- In zoomline chart, scroll is working as expected when overflow is set to `auto` in any of the div container. Previously, scroll was getting disabled in this condition.
