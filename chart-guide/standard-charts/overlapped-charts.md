## Overlapped Column 2D Chart

With version 3.13.0, FusionCharts has come up with a clever and rather effective bar chart to display your data. In this chart, the two data series overlap. The width of the plot for the data series differs which makes the chart easy to compare. 

To render the overlapped column 2D chart, set the value of the `type` attribute to `OverlappedColumn2d`. The rest of the data structure remains the same.

For a detailed list of attributes, refer to the [chart attributes]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes?chart=overlappedcolumn2d "@@open-newtab") page of overlapped column 2D chart.

The overlapped column 2D chart looks like:

{% embed_all standard-charts-overlapped-column2d-chart-example-1.js %}
