In any organization, revenue is key for growth, and the sales team manages this. For the sales team, it is important to understand how many leads from marketing efforts and organic sources converted to opportunities, and how many of these opportunities were sent pricing quotes. This leads to a pipeline of these deals and their respective revenue – which is the indicative revenue that sales can expect in that timespan (for a month or a quarter). Further, some of these deals in pipeline become lost opportunities due to multiple reasons (competitors, pricing too high, or certain features not available in the product). Finally a subset of these deals in pipeline convert to actual customers.

For sales managers and revenue stakeholders in a company, it’s very important to understand different patterns of opportunities, pipeline and closed deals to ascertain predictability in revenue. This Sales Dashboard allows the sales team to understand trends, figure out unprofitable months/quarters and discover which parts of the sales cycle need more bandwidth, process optimization or rethinking the strategy of selling itself.
