Data visualization can be an incredible driver for communicating key business information. It helps present a visual narrative that’s easier to digest for those without the time to pour over large swaths of text (think CxOs, busy senior management, or even millennials with a time crunch).

In fact, these days, that’s most of us – a generation always on the move, yet data-hungry and information-curious. We are often bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information, at work or in our personal lives. Now if this information is presented visually, instead of spreadsheets, reports, or tables, the impact could be far greater. Using best practices to boil down the points and presenting them in a more appealing format can simplify understanding and offer deeper insights.

So, it’s no surprise that businesses around the world are exploring data visualization as an important methodology. Here are the top 6 data visualization trends for 2018.

## Redundancy: It’s a Good Thing?

For all the word-wizards out there, redundancy is generally cringe-worthy. Marketers and graphic designers, however, have an entirely different take on this, using repetition to create lasting impressions. In fact, one of the oft-cited principles of graphic design is the mnemonic CRAP: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.

Repetition, or redundancy, is an important element of visual design, especially when communicating data.

Visual data relies on cursory or ‘at-a-glance’ analysis, measured in seconds, not minutes. When you’re communicating visually, there’s no guarantee the audience will actually start at the “beginning.” It’s important to lead the eye to those key points that need to be communicated quickly and effectively, and a powerful strategy for doing so is the crux of your message in unique ways.
