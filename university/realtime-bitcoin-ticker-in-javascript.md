Bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency that’s going to replace traditional fiat currency in the future – say many crypto enthusiasts. Well, that’s a fact that’s becoming more of fiction, especially after last year, when Bitcoin prices rose up astronomically to potentially hit the \$20,000 mark. While the entire world has been hoping for Bitcoin to rise and stabilize, in reality, the currency has fallen and remains unstable.

As more trading portals and online websites monitor bitcoin price fluctuations, it’s very important to monitor these real-time changes during trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

On that note, we have built a real-time bitcoin ticker dashboard. This tutorial gives a step by step guide on how to create this mini dashboard, using JavaScript, Bitcoin API and FusionCharts.
