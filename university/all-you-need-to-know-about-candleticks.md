That’s where slightly more convoluted charts come into play. A variety of data, plus the need to show several insights at once, combined with limited space – charts have to pack all of this in, and intelligently.

In the next few articles, we’ll talk about few _apparently_ complicated charts, take them apart and put them back together – explaining exactly how each component makes sense. And we also look at a set of do’s and don’ts around them.

So let’s get started – here’s how you can employ 3 difficult charts, with zero difficulty:
