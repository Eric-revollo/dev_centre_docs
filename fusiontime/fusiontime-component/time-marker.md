FusionTime lets you mark events on the [time axis](/fusiontime/fusiontime-component/time-axis). A time marker appears as an overlay on the canvas. When you hover the mouse pointer over a time marker, a tooltip appears with the information about the marker.

A time marker can be of two types:

- Time instance marker - It occurs at a given instance of time.
- Time band marker - It occurs over a span of time.

## Time instance marker

To create a single time instance marker follow the steps below:

- Create a `timeMarker` object under `xAxis` object

- Within the `timeMarker` object use the `start` attribute to define the time instance at which the marker should be drawn.

- Within the `timeMarker` object use the `timeFormat` attribute to define the format of the time specified in the `start` attribute.

- Within the `timeMarker` object use the `label` attribute to define the label for the time marker.

Refer to the code below:

```javascript
xAxis: {
    timemarker: [{
        start: 'Mar-1982',
        label: 'Economic downturn was triggered by {br} tight monetary policy in an effort to {br} fight mounting inflation.',
        timeFormat: "%b-%Y"
    }],
}
```

A sample chart with a time marker is shown below:

To create repeatable time instance markers, follow the steps given below:

- Set the above attributes and the specify the following attribute:
  - Within the `timeMarker` object create the `repeat` object to define the frequency, at which the cyclic time marker will be repeated.
  - Use the `unit` attribute to define the time unit for the time marker inside the `repeat` object. You can set its value as Year, Quarter, Month, Week, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, or Millisecond. You can also set its value as one of the weekdays (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday).
  - Use the `multiplier` attribute to define the multiplier of the time unit. By default, this value is `1`.
  - Use the `end` attribute to define the end time for the marker. Note that if you set the end of the date/time, then the marker will be presented as a band. If you omit it instead, the marker will be represented as a line.

Refer to the code below:

```javascript
xAxis: {
  plot: 'Time',
  timemarker: [{
    start: 'Mar-1980',
    label: 'US inflation peaked at 14.8%.',
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    repeat: {
      unit: 'Year',
      multiplier: 5
    },
    style: {
      marker: {
        fill: '#f8b8b7'
      }
    }
  },
}
```

The sample chart with repeated time instance markers is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-time-marker-2 %}

In the above sample, the time marker is a specific point on the time axis. You can also render the time marker from top to bottom (vertically) of the canvas by setting the value of `type` attribute to **full** within the `time marker` object.

Refer to the code given below:

```javascript
xAxis: {
    plot: 'Time',
    timemarker: [{
        start: 'Mar-1980',
        label: 'US inflation peaked at 14.8%.',
        timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
        repeat: {
            unit: 'Year',
            multiplier: 5,
            type: 'full'
        },
        style: {
            marker: {
                fill: '#f8b8b7'
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

A sample chart is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-time-instance-marker-full %}

## Time span marker

To create the marker just include the `end` attribute along with the other attributes of the single time instance marker under the `timemarker` object within the `xAxis` object. Refer to the code below:

Refer to the code below:

```javascript
xAxis: {
    plot: 'Time',
    timemarker: [{
        start: 'Mar-1980',
        end: 'Jun-1983',
        label: 'US inflation peaked at 14.8%.',
        timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
        style: {
            marker: {
                fill: '#f8b8b7'
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

A sample chart with time spam markers is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-time-marker-3 %}

In the above sample, the time marker has a specific height according to the width and height of the chart. You can also render the time span marker with a line from top to bottom (vertically) of the canvas by setting the value of `type` attribute to **full** within the `time marker` object.

Refer to the code given below:

```javascript
xAxis: {
    plot: 'Time',
    timemarker: [{
        start: 'Mar-1980',
        end: 'Jun-1983',
        label: 'US inflation peaked at 14.8%.',
        timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
        type: 'full',
        style: {
            marker: {
                fill: '#f8b8b7'
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

A sample chart is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-time-span-marker-full %}

## Style Definition

You can add CSS styling to set the cosmetic properties of data markers. To set the styling, instead of creating a separate CSS file, you can define the styling using `StyleDefinition` object.

Now, let's define the `styleDefinition` object and set the **color** in an object. The code is given below:

```javascript
styleDefinition: {
    "colorstyle": {
        "fill": "#ff0000",
        "font-weight": "bold"
    }
}
```

Once the `StyleDefinition` is defined, you can refer it for the various components using `colorstyle` attribute.

The syntax to set the `StyleDefintion` to the data marker is given below:

```javascript
{
  "seriesName": String,
  "time": String,
  "timeFormat": String,
  "type": String,
  "identifier": Character
  "tooltext": String,
  "style": {
        "text": colorStyle,
        "marker": colorStyle
    }
}
```

In the above code, `colorStyle` object is called to set the color of the data marker.

The chart after applying the above attributes will look like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-data-marker-style-definition %}

In the above sample, **font color** of the y-axis label has been changed.
