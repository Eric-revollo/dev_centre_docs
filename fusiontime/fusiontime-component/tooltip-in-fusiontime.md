Tooltips provide on-demand additional context for different visual elements in a chart. They pop up when you hover the mouse pointer over an element or tap (on mobile devices) on it. Chart elements that can have tooltips include data plots, data labels, and the axes.

The above image is of a single series chart which displays context-sensitive information in the tooltip when the pointer has hovered over a particular data plot. The information displayed in the tooltip includes:

- Date
- Column name
- Value of the data plot

Now, letâ€™s create a multi-series chart which will compare online sales of SuperStore in United States of America and India.

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-multi-series %}

In the given example, you can see a multi-series line graph - displaying the sales figures of a company in India and in United States of America. Hover the mouse pointer over a particular time on the time axis, and you will see a consolidated tooltip showing the names and sales values for both data plots at that point.

Tooltips are extremely useful when you want to compare data using a multivariate chart. In a multivariate chart, when you hover over a data plot in one of the canvases, tooltips appear in the other canvases at that particular point in time as well.

In the example given above, you can see the Global Online Sales of a Superstore, with the canvases showcasing the sales, quantities sold, and shipping costs in three different canvases. When you hover the pointer over a particular plot in the Sales canvas, you will notice that tooltips appear in the Quantity and Shipping Cost canvases as well, at the same point. This way, you can easily view consolidated data regarding sales at any point in time.

By default, the tooltip is displayed. To hide the tooltip set the `enabled` attribute to `false`.

Refer to the code below:

```javascript
"dataSource": {
    "tooltip": {
        "enabled": "false", // Disables the Tooltip
    }
}
```

## Tooltips in Time Markers

Tooltips help you gain additional, context-sensitive information from time markers. When you hover the mouse pointer over a time marker, a tooltip appears with the value of the marker, as well as any information you include in the tooltext of the `timemarker` object for that particular tooltip. When a time marker represents a range, the corresponding tooltip displays information on the range instead.

For instance, depending on the date/time format you select, the data in the tooltip will look like one of the following:

- November 11, 2018
- November 10-13, 2018
- Oct 29 - Nov 6, 2018
- Dec 28, 2017 - Jan 10, 2018
- Nov 5, 2018 16:00 - 20:00
- Nov 5, 16:00 - Nov 6, 2018 23:00
- Dec 31, 2017 18:00 - Jan 1, 2018 12:00

## Tooltips in Data Markers

Tooltips can provide additional information about the data represented by [data markers](/fusiontime/fusiontime-component/data-markers). When you hover the mouse pointer over a data marker, a tooltip can appear and display the data value, as well as a small description.

## Style Definition

FusionTime allows you to customize the tooltip of the chart. All the customizations to the tooltip can be made using the newly introduced `tooltip` object under `dataSource`. The customization effects all the tooltips of the chart, i.e.:

- Plot Tooltip
- Data Marker Tooltip
- Time Marker Tooltip

> The styling of the tooltip in FusionTime is handled by **HTML** styling.

The syntax of the `tooltip` object is given below:

```javascript
"dataSource": {
    "tooltip": {
        "enabled": Boolean,
        "style": {
            "container": {
                "padding": "10px"
            },
            "text": {
                "font-size": "16"
            },
            "header": {
                "font-color": "#ff0000"
                },
            "body": {
                "font-color": "#ff00ff"
                }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code:

- `tooltip` is the object to customize the tooltip of the chart.
- `enabled` attribute is used to enable or disable the tooltip.
- The customization for the tooltip is in `style` object.
  - `container` customizes the containing box of the tooltip.
  - `text` customizes the text of the tooltip.
  - `header` customizes the header at the top of the tooltip.
  - `body` customizes all the text other than the `header` text.
