Crossline is a horizontal and vertical line/area used as a reference for the data plots. When you hover the mouse pointer on a plot a dotted/dashed horizontal and vertical line appears with the information of that data plot. Vertical crossline helps in mapping the time axis whereas the horizontal crossline helps in y-axis mapping. When you hover the mouse pointer over a data plot, an additional label and a tag float on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. 

A cross line appears as shown in the image below:

By default, a vertical crossline will map the time axis. Hover the mouse pointer over an anchor, a horizontal crossline with tags (having values) on the quantitative (or y) axis will show up. The tooltip that appears has all the information required, for example, data values, labels of each data plot and also the color of the data plots.

You can also hover the mouse pointer along the crossline from one chart to another to see the data values in tooltips and quickly gain more insights about the data.

By default, crosslines are visible in every chart. However, you can turn them off if you want.
