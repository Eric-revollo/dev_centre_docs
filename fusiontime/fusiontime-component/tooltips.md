A tooltip is a rectangular box that displays additional information of a particular data plot when you hover on the data plot. In FusionTime, charts have consolidated tooltips which display the detail of the hovered element.

The above image is of a tooltip which displays infomration of the data plot, such as: 

* **Date**
* **Column** name
* **Value** of that particular data plot.

Now, let's create a chart with multiple plots which will compare online sales of SuperStore in the US and India.

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-multi-series %}

In the given example, hover on the data plot and you will see a consolidated tooltip showing the names and values for both data plots at that point of time. 

By default, the tooltip is displayed. To hide the tooltip set the `showToolTip` attribute to `0`.

Refer to the code below:

```
{
    chart: { },
    "showToolTip": "0", // Disables the Tooltip
    caption: {
        text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in India & the US'
    }
}
```

### Tooltips in a multivariate chart 

In FusionTime, you can have different canvases for different measures visualized in a multivariate chart. When you hover on a data plot, by default tooltips get displayed in all the canvases of the chart. Refer to the image below:

To disable multiple tooltips, set the `multiCanvasTooltip` attribute to `0`.

### Tooltips in Time Markers

Tooltips help you gain additional, context-sensitive information from [time markers](/fusiontime/fusiontime-component/time-marker). When you hover the mouse pointer over a time marker, a tooltip appears with information on the value of the marker, as well as a description about the data. When a time marker represents a range, the corresponding tooltip displays information on the range instead.

### Tooltips in Data Markers

Tooltips can provide additional information about the data represented by [data markers](/fusiontime/fusiontime-component/data-markers). When you hover the mouse pointer over a data marker, a tooltip can appear and display the data value, as well as a small description.
