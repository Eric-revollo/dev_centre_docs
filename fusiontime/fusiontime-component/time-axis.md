The Time Axis in FusionTime is the x-axis which represents time.It intelligently scales the x-axis depending on the number of plots displayed in the active window. The Time Axis automatically updates itself as soon as the viewer makes a selection using the <<Time Navigator>> or zooming/panning on the chart canvas. The individual plots are indicated with user-friendly ticks.

The major features of the Time Axis include the following:

* Major and minor ticks indicate time instances (contextual to the data).

* Each label text is centrally aligned. Every label appears right below its corresponding tick.

* The visibility of labels associated with time axis tick marks is smartly controlled, to reduce clutter and help the viewer understand the data better.

* The Time Axis supports almost all types of time-related units, from milliseconds (smallest) to years (largest).
