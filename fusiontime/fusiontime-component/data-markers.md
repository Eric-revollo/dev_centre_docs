Data marker in a chart represents an important event, which occurred on a specific data point. Hovering on a data marker shows additional description of the event in the tooltip.

The image below shows the data marker on a time series chart:

## Create Data Markers

To create data Markers follow the setps given below:

- Create a `dataMarker` object.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `seriesName` attribute to specify the exact name of the series, against which the data marker will be displayed. If you need to mention the exact name of the series as a combination of a series name and a measure name, then specify it in the format `<series_name>-<measure_name>`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `time` attribute to set the time instance on which the data marker will be displayed.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `timeFormat` attribute to set the format of the date/time corresponding to the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `type` attribute to define the type of the marker as `flag`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `identifier` attribute to set the character to be displayed within the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `tooltext` attribute to set the text to be displayed in the tooltip, when you hover the mouse pointer over the data marker.

Refer to the code given below:

```
dataMarker: [{
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Mar-1980",
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "As a part of credit control program, under the leadership of Paul Volcker, the Fed tightened the money supply, allowing the federal fund rates to approach 20 percent."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Aug-1982",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "The FED eases off the monetary brakes, allowing interest rates to fall and the economy to begin a strong recovery."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
