Filters in FusionTime are predefined functions which help in filtering out some specific data you want to visualize in the chart. Some of the predefined filters in FusionTime are:

* Greater
* Less
* Equals
* Between

## Greater

**Greater** is a filter which can be used when you want to filter the data values greater than a specific numeric value. Let's assume that we have data with values from 100 to 1500. Out of these values, you only want to visualize the values greater than 500. In this scenario, we have to use the `greater` operator which will render the chart using data plots with the value above 500.

For better understanding, let's create a chart with no filters applied to it. For example, a chart showcasing online sales of SuperStore in the United States of America.

The chart is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-single-series %}

Now, let's apply the `greater` filter and set its value to **500**. The chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart getting-started-filter-greater %}

In the above chart, the rendered data plot's values are greater than **500**. The data structure to set the `greater` filter is shown below:

```javascript
//Greater Filter Applied to the DataTable in the Data Store
let fusionDataStore = new FusionCharts.DataStore();
let fusionTable = fusionDataStore.createDataTable(data, schema);
var greater1 = FusionCharts.DataStore.Operators.greater('Sales', 500);
var dataT_1 = dataT.query(greater1);

new FusionCharts({
	type: 'timeseries',
	renderAt: 'container',
	width: '95%',
	height: 500,
	dataSource: {
    	data: dataT_1,
    	chart: {
    	},
    	caption: {
      		text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in the US'
    	}
	}
}).render()
```

In the above code:

* Store the `dataTable` in a variable.
* Set the `greater` filter using the `FusionCharts.DataStore` constructor.
* Apply the filter to the `dataTable`.

## Less

**Less** is a filter which can be used when you want to filter the data less than a specific numeric value. Let's assume that we have data with values from 100 to 1500. Out of these values, you only want to visualize the values less than 1000. In this scenario, we have to use the `less` filter which will render the chart using data plots with the value below 1000.

Let's apply the `less` filter to the above chart and set its value to **1000**. The chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart getting-started-filter-less %}

In the above chart, the rendered data plot's values are less than **1000**. The data structure to set the `less` filter is shown below:

```javascript
//Less Filter Applied to the DataTable in the Data Store
let fusionDataStore = new FusionCharts.DataStore();
let fusionTable = fusionDataStore.createDataTable(data, schema);
var less1 = FusionCharts.DataStore.Operators.less('Sales', 1000);
var dataT_1 = dataT.query(less1);

new FusionCharts({
	type: 'timeseries',
	renderAt: 'container',
	width: '95%',
	height: 500,
	dataSource: {
    	data: dataT_1,
    	chart: {
    	},
    	caption: {
      		text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in the US'
    	}
	}
}).render()
```

In the above code:

* Store the `dataTable` in a variable.
* Set the `less` filter using the `FusionCharts.DataStore` constructor.
* Apply the filter to the `dataTable`.

## Equals

Equals is a filter which can be used when you want to filter specific data value. Letâ€™s assume that we have global  sales data. Out of this data, you only want to visualize the sales data for **India**. In this scenario, use the `equals` operator which will render the chart using data plots only for **India**.

Let's apply the `equals` filter to the above single series chart and set its value to **India**.

The chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart getting-started-filter-equals %}

In the above chart, the rendered data plots are sales data for **India**. The data structure to set the `equals` filter is shown below:

```javascript
//Equals Filter Applied to theDataTablein the Data Store
let fusionDataStore = new FusionCharts.DataStore();
let fusionTable = fusionDataStore.createDataTable(data, schema);
var equals1 = FusionCharts.DataStore.Operators.equals('Country', 'India');
var dataT_1 = dataT.query(equals1);

new FusionCharts({
	type: 'timeseries',
	renderAt: 'container',
	width: '95%',
	height: 500,
	dataSource: {
    	data: dataT_1,
    	chart: {
    	},
    	caption: {
      		text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in India'
    	}
	}
}).render()
```

In the above code:

* Store the `dataTable` in a variable.
* Set the `equals` filter using the `FusionCharts.DataStore` constructor.
* Apply the filter to the `dataTable`.

## Between

**Between** is a filter which can be used when you want to render the chart using data between specific date/time or value. Let's assume that we have data with values from 100 to 1500. Out of these values, you only want to visualize the values from 500 to 1000. In this scenario, we have to use the `between` filter which will render the chart using data plots with the value from 500 to 1000.

Let's apply the `between` filter to the above single series chart and set its value from 500 to 1000. The chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart getting-started-filter-between %}

In the above chart, the rendered data plot's values are more than **500** but less than **1000**. The data structure to set the `between` filter is shown below:

```javascript
//Between Filter Applied to the DataTable in the Data Store
let fusionDataStore = new FusionCharts.DataStore();
let fusionTable = fusionDataStore.createDataTable(data, schema);
var between1 = FusionCharts.DataStore.Operators.between('Sales', 500, 1000);
var dataT_1 = dataT.query(between1);

new FusionCharts({
	type: 'timeseries',
	renderAt: 'container',
	width: '95%',
	height: 500,
	dataSource: {
    	data: dataT_1,
    	chart: {
    	},
    	caption: {
      		text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in the US'
    	}
	}
}).render()
```

In the above code:

* Store the `dataTable` in a variable.
* Set the `between` filter using the `FusionCharts.DataStore` constructor.
* Apply the filter to the `dataTable`.
