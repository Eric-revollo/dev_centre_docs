FusionTime is a JavaScript charting library that helps you visualize and explore time-series data. In FusionTime, you get lots of out-of-the-box interactivity, like, time navigator, date range selectors, tooltips with crosslines, interactive legend and more features, which enhance the experience of exploring and understanding time series data.

We have built a simple `FusionCharts Django` wrapper, which provides bindings for FusionTime. The `FusionCharts Django` wrapper allows you to easily add interactive time-series charts to any Django project.

## Installation

In this section, we will show you how to install FusionCharts Suite XT and the `FusionCharts Django` wrapper along with all the other dependencies on your system.

## Requirements

To create a chart in a web app developed using Django, download the following wrappers and frameworks in your system:

- Django Framework - [Link](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
- FusionCharts Library - [Link](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/fusioncharts-suite-xt)
- FusionCharts Django wrapper - [Link](https://www.fusioncharts.com/django-charts/)

Note that the `FusionCharts Django` wrapper requires Python 2.7 or higher.

**Step 1:** Create a project

To create a project, follow the steps given below:

* Open the command prompt and run `cd` command to navigate to the required directory.

* Run the following command to create a **myproject** directory in your preferred directory.

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

**Step 2:** Add the dependencies

Now, we will add `Django wrapper` and FusionCharts JavaScript files required to render the charts in the web application. Steps to add the files are given below:

* Create a **template** folder inside the **myproject** directory.

* Inside the **template** folder, create another folder named **static**.

* Copy and paste the `fusioncharts.py` file from `integrations > django > fusioncharts-wrapper` in your project folder (**myproject**).

* Copy all JavaScript files extracted from the downloaded FusionCharts library into the **template/static** folder.

* Now, map the JavaScript files by creating an HTML file, `index.html` in the template folder. Include the `fusioncharts.js` and `fusioncharts.timeseries.js` using `<script>` tags from the downloaded package in this file.

<div class="code-wrapper">
<ul class='code-tabs extra-tabs'>
    <li class='active'><a data-toggle='cdn'>CDN</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle='local'>Local Files</a></li>
</ul>
<div class='tab-content extra-tabs'>

<div class='tab cdn-tab active'>
<pre><code class="language-php">
{% load static %}
// Include FusionCharts core file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.js"&gt;&lt;/script>
// Include FusionTime file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.timeseries.js"&gt;&lt;/script>
</code><button class='btn btn-outline-secondary btn-copy' title='Copy to clipboard'>COPY</button>
</pre>
</div>

<div class='tab local-tab'>
<pre><code class="language-php">
{% load static %}
// Include FusionCharts core file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="{% static "fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.js" %}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
// Include FusionTime file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="{% static "fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.timeseries.js" %}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code><button class='btn btn-outline-secondary btn-copy' title='Copy to clipboard'>COPY</button>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

After including the paths of all the dependencies required, update the static files by running the following command:

```bash
Python manage.py collectStatic
```

In the `settings.py` file, update the location of the templates:

```bash
'DIRS': ['myproject/templates']
```

## Create Your First Chart

Now that you have installed FusionTime and `FusionCharts Django` wrapper, let us build the first chart to show the **Daily sales of a grocery store**.

The chart will look as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart integrations-django %}

The data for the above chart is shown in the table below:

| Time      | Sales |
| --------- | ----- |
| 01-Feb-11 | 8866  |
| 02-Feb-11 | 2174  |
| 03-Feb-11 | 2084  |
| 04-Feb-11 | 1503  |
| 05-Feb-11 | 4928  |
| 06-Feb-11 | 4667  |
| 07-Feb-11 | 1064  |

FusionCharts accepts a DataTable as the data source. `DataTable` is a part of `DataStore`, which is a tabular representation of the data. To create the `DataTable`, you need to provide the following:

* `schema` - which defines the properties of the columns.  

* `data` - values of each row and column of the `DataTable`.

> For an instance of FusionTime, you can create `n` number of `DataTables`, but only one `DataStore`.

Next, let's learn how to prepare the schema and the data of the `DataTable`.

### Create the `schema`

The schema outlines each column represented in the above table. The schema contains an array which has multiple objects created in it. Each object represents a column in the `DataTable`.

> `name` and `type` are mandatory keys for each object. If the object type is `time` then `format` is also a mandatory key.

To define the schema, let's create a `schema.json` file and copy the following code:

> It is not mandatory to create the schema in a different `.json` file. You can also define the schema within the `.html` file.

```json
Let schema = [{
    "name": "Time",
    "type": "date",
    "format": "%-m/%-d/%Y"
}, {
    "name": "Sales",
    "type": "number"
}]
```

In the above code:

* Each object of a schema maps to a column of the tabular representation of the data.

* The `JSON` object has the following attributes:

    * `name` - Specify the name of the column of the tabular representation of data

    * `type` - Specify the type of the column.

    * `format` - Specify the input format of the date as per your data. In this example, the format is `%-m/%-d/%Y`. To know more about date formats, click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/fusiontime/fusiontime-attributes).

Now that we have the schema ready, let's work on the data.

### Create the `data`

[Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusioncharts/dev_centre_docs/master/assets/datasources/fusiontime/integrations-aspnet/data.json) for the above chart is too big to be shown here. A sample of it has been used in the data object defined below:

```json
var data = [
    [
        "1/4/2011",
        16.448
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        272.736
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        11.784
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        3.54
    ],
    [
        "1/6/2011",
        19.536
    ],
    [
        "1/7/2011",
        2573.82
    ],
]
```

Create a new `data.json` file, and copy the above code there.

> It is not mandatory to create a `data.json` file. You can also include the data in your HTML file.

In the above code:

* Each object in the data array corresponds to a row in the tabular representation of the data.

* Each element in an object is represented by each object of the `schema`. The values in each object of the array represent the following:

    * Time according to the format

    * Total Sales amount 

We are all set with our data to create the chart.

> By default, FusionTime applies the average function to aggregate the data and display on the chart. You can change the aggregate function from `average` to any other numeric calculation. To know more, click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/fusiontime/getting-started/change-default-aggregation).

Now, let's create the files to render the above chart.

## Render the Chart

Once you have the `data` and the `schema` ready, create a `.py` file and copy the following code:

```javascript
from ..fusioncharts import FusionCharts
from ..fusioncharts import FusionTable
from ..fusioncharts import TimeSeries
```

In the above code, you can see how to include the `fusioncharts.py` file and import the classes, which have the functions needed to embed the charts in an HTML page.

Basic code to render a chart:

```javascript
fusionTable = FusionTable(schema, data)
timeSeries = TimeSeries(fusionTable)

# Wrapper constructor parameters
# charttype, chartID, width, height, renderAt, data format, TimeSeries object

fcChart = FusionCharts("timeseries", "MyFirstChart" , "700", "450", "chart-container", "json", timeSeries)

# Returning complete JavaScript and HTML code, which is used to generate chart in the browsers.
return render(request,'index.html', {'output':fcChart.render()})
```

In the above code:

* The following parameter values have been set for the `chart` wrapper constructor:

    * Value of `charttype` has been set to `timeseries`.

    * Value of `chartID` has been set to `MyFirstChart`.

    * Value of `width` has been set to `700`.

    * Value of `height` has been set to `450`.

    * Value of `renderAt` has been set to `chart-container`.

    * Value of `data format` has been set to `json`.

    * Value of the time-series object has been set to `timeSeries`.

* The `render()` member function of the `FusionCharts` wrapper has been used to render the chart.

That's it! Your first chart in **Django** using FusionTime is ready.
