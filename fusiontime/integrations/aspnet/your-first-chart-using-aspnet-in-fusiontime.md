FusionTime is a JavaScript charting library that helps you visualize, and explore time-series data. In FusionTime, you get lots of out-of-the-box interactivity, like, time navigator, date range selectors, tooltips with crosslines, interactive legend and more features which enhances the experience of exploring and understanding time series data.

We have built a simple `FusionCharts server-side ASP.NET` wrapper, which provides bindings for FusionTime. The `FusionCharts server-side ASP.NET` wrapper allows you to easily add interactive time-series charts to any ASP.NET project.

## Installation

Since FusionTime is distributed along with FusionCharts Suite, download/install the **FusionCharts** package to get access to FusionTime. Note that you will also need .NET Framework 3.5 or later version to use FusionTime.

> The **FusionCharts ASP.NET server-side wrapper** requires **.NET Framework 3.5** or higher.

* Include the **FusionCharts** JavaScript files, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/fusioncharts-suite).

* Copy the FusionCharts.cs or FusionCharts.vb class (C#/VB) file from `integrations > asp.net-cs >fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for C#) or `integration > asp.net-vb > fusioncharts-wrapper-source` (for VB) to `App_Code` folder inside your project.

* Include the **FusionTime** file to render time-series charts.

The consolidated code is shown below:

<div class="code-wrapper">
<ul class='code-tabs extra-tabs'>
    <li class='active'><a data-toggle='cdn'>CDN</a></li>
    <li><a data-toggle='local'>Local Files</a></li>
</ul>
<div class='tab-content extra-tabs'>

<div class='tab cdn-tab active'>
<pre><code class="language-php">
// Include FusionCharts core file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.js"&gt;&lt;/script>

// Include FusionTime file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.timeseries.js"&gt;&lt;/script>
</code><button class='btn btn-outline-secondary btn-copy' title='Copy to clipboard'>COPY</button>
</pre>
</div>

<div class='tab local-tab'>
<pre><code class="language-php">
// Include FusionCharts core file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

// Include FusionTime file
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.timeseries.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code><button class='btn btn-outline-secondary btn-copy' title='Copy to clipboard'>COPY</button>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

That completes the installation of **FusionTime** and the `ASP.NET` wrapper.

## Create Your First Chart

Now that you have installed FusionTime and `FusionCharts server-side ASP.NET` wrapper, let us build the first chart to show the **Daily sales of a grocery store**.

The chart will look as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart integrations-aspnet %}

The data for the above chart is shown in the table below:

| Time      | Sales |
| --------- | ----- |
| 01-Feb-11 | 8866  |
| 02-Feb-11 | 2174  |
| 03-Feb-11 | 2084  |
| 04-Feb-11 | 1503  |
| 05-Feb-11 | 4928  |
| 06-Feb-11 | 4667  |
| 07-Feb-11 | 1064  |

FusionTime accepts a `DataTable` as the data source. `DataTable` is a part of `DataStore`, which is a tabular representation of the data. To create the `DataTable`, you need to provide the following:

* `schema` - which defines the properties of the columns.  

* `data` - values of each row and column of the `DataTable`.

> For an instance of FusionTime, you can create `n` number of `DataTables`, but only one `DataStore`.

Next, let's learn how to prepare the schema and the data of the `DataTable`.

### Create the `schema`

The schema outlines each column represented in the above table. The schema contains an array which has multiple objects created in it. Each object represents a column in the `DataTable`.

> `name` and `type` are mandatory keys for each object. If the object type is `time` then `format` is also a mandatory key.

To define the schema, let's create a `schema.json` file and copy the following code:

> It is not mandatory to create the schema in a different `.json` file. You can also define the schema within the `.html` file.

```json
[{
    "name": "Time",
    "type": "date",
    "format": "%-m/%-d/%Y"
}, {
    "name": "Sales",
    "type": "number"
}]
```

In the above code:

* `schema` is the variable in which the array is stored.

* Each object of a schema maps to a column of the tabular representation of the data.

* The JSON object has the following attributes:

    * name - Specify the name of the column of the tabular representation of data

    * type - Specify the type of the column.

    * format - Specify the input format of the date as per your data. In this example, the format is `%-m/%-d/%Y`. To know more about date formats, click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/fusiontime/fusiontime-attributes).

Now that we have the schema ready, let's work on the data.

### Create the `data`

[Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusioncharts/dev_centre_docs/master/assets/datasources/fusiontime/integrations-aspnet/data.json) for the above chart is too big to be shown here. A sample of it has been used in the data object defined below:

```json
[
    [
        "1/4/2011",
        16.448
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        272.736
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        11.784
    ],
    [
        "1/5/2011",
        3.54
    ],
    [
        "1/6/2011",
        19.536
    ],
    [
        "1/7/2011",
        2573.82
    ],
]
```

Create a new `data.json` file, and copy the above code there. 

> It is not mandatory to create a `data.json` file. You could also include the data in your HTML file.

In the above code:

* Each object in the data array corresponds to a row in the tabular representation of the data.

* Each element in an object is represented by each object of the `schema`. The values in each object of the array represent the following:

    * Time according to the format

    * Total sales amount 

We are all set with our data to create the chart.

> By default, FusionTime applies the `average` function to aggregate the data and display on the chart. You can change the aggregate function from `average` to any other numeric calculation. To know more, click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/fusiontime/getting-started/change-default-aggregation).

Now, let's create the files to render the above chart.

### Render the chart

Once you have the `data` and the `schema` ready, create a `.aspx` file and copy the following code:

```javascript
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using FusionCharts.Charts;
using System.Net;
public partial class index : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Local variables for consuming schema and data information.
        string schema, data;
        // Fetch data and schema information from remote url and store these in local schema and data variables.
        using (WebClient client = new WebClient())
        {
            data = client.DownloadString("..PATH/data.json");
            schema = client.DownloadString("..PATH/schema.json");
        }
        // Create and initialize FusionTable object instance with the constructor parameters of data and schema.
        FusionTable fusionTable = new FusionTable(schema, data);
        // Create and initialize TimeSeries object instance with the constructor parameters of FusionTable object instance.
        TimeSeries timeSeries = new TimeSeries(fusionTable);
        // Wrapper constructor parameters
        // charttype, chartID, width, height, data format, TimeSeries object
        Chart chart = new Chart("timeseries", "first_chart", "700", "450", "json", timeSeries);
        Literal1.Text = chart.Render();
    }
}
```

In the above code:

- `schema` and `data` are the variables to comsume informations of `schema` and `data` file.
- `using()` is used to store the informations of data and schema to the variables.
- Create and initialize `FusionTable` object instance with the constructor parameters of data and schema.
- Create and initialize `TimeSeries` object instance with the constructor parameters of FusionTable object instance.
- The following parameter values have been set for the Chart object of the FusionCharts wrapper constructor:
    - Value of `charttype` has been set to `timeseries`.
    - Value of `chartID` has been set to `first_chart`.
    - Value of `width` has been set to `700`.
    - Value of `height` has been set to `450`.
    - Value of `data format` has been set to `json`
    - The time-series object `timeSeries` has been provided.
-  The `render()` function has been applied to the `Literal1` container to render the chart.

That's it! Your first chart in **ASP.NET** using FusionTime is ready.
