## Remove FusionCharts Trial mark

To remove the FusionCharts watermark, you have to buy a FusionCharts licensed version and use the downloaded files as a custom library. You can either contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@fusioncharts.com) or go to our [pricing page](https://www.fusioncharts.com/buy) to download the licensed package of FusionCharts.

You can override the default package version of **FusionCharts** in **FusionExport** with your current version by passing your custom FusionCharts directory to the `-L` options of FusionExport.

```bash
./fusionexport -L <path_to_fusioncharts_lib>
```

To remove the FusionCharts watermark, follow the steps below:

- Copy all the files in the `js` folder of your licensed distribution.
- Place all the files present inside the `js` folder in folder named `fusioncharts` beside your `fusionexport` file.

To run licensed FusionExport with licensed FusionCharts run:

```bash
./fusionexport -L fusioncharts/
```

After removing the watermarks, the chart looks like:
