Data marker in a chart represents an important event, which occurred on a specific data point. Hovering on a data marker shows additional description of the event in the tooltip.

The image below shows the data marker on a time series chart:

## Create Data Markers

To create data Markers follow the setps given below:

- Create a `dataMarker` object.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `seriesName` attribute to specify the exact name of the series, against which the data marker will be displayed. If you need to mention the exact name of the series as a combination of a series name and a measure name, then specify it in the format `<series_name>-<measure_name>`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `time` attribute to set the time instance on which the data marker will be displayed.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `timeFormat` attribute to set the format of the date/time corresponding to the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `type` attribute to define the type of the marker as `flag`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `identifier` attribute to set the character to be displayed within the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `tooltext` attribute to set the text to be displayed in the tooltip, when you hover the mouse pointer over the data marker.

Refer to the code given below:

```
dataMarker: [{
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Mar-1980",
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "As a part of credit control program, under the leadership of Paul Volcker, the Fed tightened the money supply, allowing the federal fund rates to approach 20 percent."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Aug-1982",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "The FED eases off the monetary brakes, allowing interest rates to fall and the economy to begin a strong recovery."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Oct-1987",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "The FED is forced to ease rate after the stock market crash."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "May-1989",
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Liquidity problem forced the Fed to increase rate to nearly 10%."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Sept-1992",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "To fight the jobless economy growth the Fed had to reduce the interest rate to 3%."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Jun-2003",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Struggling to revive the economy, the FED cuts itâ€™s benchmark rate to 1%."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Sep-2007",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Fed started reducing the Federal Fund Rate."
}, {
    seriesName: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Dec-2008",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Fed reduced the interest rates to sub 0.25% to manage the menace of longest economic downturn since World War 2"
}],
```

The data marker created using the above code is shown below:

## Data Marker

You can use a Data Marker in a chart to indicate an important event, which occurred on a specific data point. You can hover the mouse pointer over a data marker or tap on it to show additional description of the event in the tooltip.

A data marker looks as shown in the image below:

### Configure Data Marker

A data marker mark a single point on the data plot. Use the `AddMarker()` instance of `DataMarkerObject` to create a data marker. `AddMarker()` accepts a string type parameter, which you need to use, to mention the name of the data series that will display the marker. Once you create the data marker, use the following instance methods of `AddMarker()` to configure the data marker:

- Use the `Identifier()` method, which accepts a character parameter, to set the character you want to display within the marker.

- Use the `Time()` method, which accepts a string parameter, to set the time of the data point where you want to display the marker.

- Use the `Tooltext()` method, which accepts a string parameter, to set the tooltext of the data marker.

- Use the `Type()` method, which accepts a `TimeSeries.DataMarker.MarkerType` enum with a value of `FLAG` or `PIN`, to indicate how you want to display the data marker on the plot.

- Use the `TimeFormat()` method, which accepts a string parameter, to set the time format for the data marker.

Refer to the code below:

```
/* AddMarker returns an instance of DataMarkerObject */
/* Identifier(), Time(),ToolText(),Type(),TimeFormat() are instance method of AddMarker and can be invoked as : */
timeSeries.DataMarker.AddMarker("series name").Identifier('.').Time("Oct-1987").ToolText("The FED is forced to ease rate after the stock market crash").Type(TimeSeries.DataMarker.MarkerType.FLAG).TimeFormat("%b-%Y");|
```

The chart will look as shown below:
