Previously, we have learned how to create a [simple chart](/fusiontime/getting-started/create-your-first-chart-in-fusiontime) with one data plot. FusionTime allows you to visualize charts with multiple plots.

In this article, we'll create our first chart with multiple plots which will compare online sales of SuperStore in the **US** and **India**.

The chart is shown below:
