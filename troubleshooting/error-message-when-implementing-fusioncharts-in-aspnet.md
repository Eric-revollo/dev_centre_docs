You might see **"are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?"** while implementing the FusionCharts ASP.NET Wrapper. Check whether `FusionCharts.dll` is added as Assembly reference. Also, check whether the Namespace is used by `Using` keyword.

If your issue is still not resolved, please raise a ticket at [support email](support@fusioncharts.com).
