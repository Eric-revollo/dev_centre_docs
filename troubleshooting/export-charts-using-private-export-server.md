To export your charts using Private Export Server, you need FusionCharts Export Handlers as a dependency. This is located inside the downloaded folder of FusionCharts. Here is the file path:

**Fusioncharts[download package]** ----> **export-handlers** ----> all the server side export handlers are located here.
